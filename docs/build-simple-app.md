# Building A Simple Dapr Application

In this guide, you’ll simulate an application by running the sidecar and calling the API directly. After running Dapr using the Dapr CLI, you’ll:

- Save a state object.
- Read/get the state object.
- Delete the state object.

## Pre-requisites

> This guide assumes, you have completed the environment setup by following [README.md](../README.md)

In order to run more human readable terminal commands for sending/receiving HTTP data, I recommend using [HTTPIe](https://httpie.io/cli).
HTTPIe is built from the ground up for painless testing and debugging of APIs, HTTP servers, and web services.

[Install HTTPIe](https://httpie.io/docs/cli/installation) for your platform and verify installation:

```sh
http
```

This should output similar to:

```sh
usage:
    http [METHOD] URL [REQUEST_ITEM ...]

error:
    the following arguments are required: URL

for more information:
    run 'http --help' or visit https://httpie.io/docs/cli
```

## Start a Dapr Application

The dapr run command launches an application, together with a sidecar.

Launch a Dapr sidecar that will listen on port 3500 for a blank application named `myapp`:

```sh
dapr run --app-id myapp --dapr-http-port 3500
```

> Since no custom component folder was defined with the above command, Dapr uses the default component definitions created during the dapr init flow.

This should output similar to:

```sh

## Save State

By posting the below JSON, you will set the state of the application

```sh
echo -n '[{ "key": "name", "value": "Bruce Wayne"}]' | http POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0/state/statestore
```

This should output similar to:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Date: Fri, 24 Feb 2023 19:10:37 GMT
Traceparent: 00-0adec51881207429def6009d09cf532d-3ca1eae3779edc3b-01
```

## View State

By querying state store below by `name` which was the state `key` in the previous setup, you will get the state of the application

```sh
http http://localhost:3500/v1.0/state/statestore/name
```

This should output similar to:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 13
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Fri, 24 Feb 2023 19:31:33 GMT
Etag: 1
Traceparent: 00-aa514889960f0f4dfb0009d47d926110-6f70bdaf1c2bf950-01

"Bruce Wayne"

```

## Delete State

You can delete the state data by simply calling by key `name`:

```sh
http DELETE http://localhost:3500/v1.0/state/statestore/name
```

This should output similar to:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Date: Fri, 24 Feb 2023 19:32:45 GMT
Traceparent: 00-8808b9427cac2d4d1b73946ee4a45ddd-534660d587754c24-01
```

To confirm the state is deleted, simply query the state store by key `name`:

```sh
http http://localhost:3500/v1.0/state/statestore/name
```

This should output similar to:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Date: Fri, 24 Feb 2023 19:33:27 GMT
Traceparent: 00-13f7ace4cc273df3e69f44b2f590e0c0-0f09c6b691dab56d-01
```
